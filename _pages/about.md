I am a third-year undergraduate student in the <a href='http://www.ee.iitkgp.ac.in/'>Department of Electrical Engineering</a> at the <a href='http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/'>Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur</a>, with a strong passion for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in the intersection of techniques such as unsupervised learning, generative models, and domain adaptation, with a previous focus on biomedical image processing. I have developed novel methods for improving the understanding and interpretation of medical images through unsupervised domain adaptation, and I am excited to continue exploring new applications and furthering my knowledge in the field.

During the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to intern at the Representation Learning Lab at IISc Bangalore under the guidance of Dr Prathosh AP. My work there centred on advancing the state-of-the-art in unsupervised image-to-image domain adaptation techniques for medical imaging datasets. Through this experience, I made a significant contribution to a research paper that is now under review for publication in the Medical Image Analysis journal.

After completing my undergraduate studies, I am eager to continue pursuing a career in research. I am excited about the prospect of delving deeper into the field of deep representation learning, and I am committed to making meaningful contributions to the field. In the short term, I am looking to pursue graduate studies in the form of a Master's program or Doctoral studies as a PhD student. This will allow me to expand my knowledge and skills and work alongside some of the brightest minds in the field, which will help me achieve my goal of becoming a leading researcher in the field.

Apart from my research interests, I am also passionate about other things. I am a big movie buff and enjoy watching and discussing different genres of movies. I am also an avid sports enthusiast and enjoy playing cricket and badminton. Maintaining a balance between work and hobbies is important for my overall well-being. I also have a keen interest in travelling and particularly enjoy visiting mountainous regions, where I hope to continue to explore and improve my photography skills in the future. These hobbies and interests help me take a break from my research and come back with a fresh perspective.
